# Homework 9 — Chronomancer's Vault: Visitor + Memento

## Overview

In this assignment you will implement two behavioral design patterns inside a time-warped RPG vault:

- **Visitor** appraises heterogeneous artifacts without `instanceof` chains
- **Memento** saves and restores a hero's state through time crystals

The two patterns are intentionally independent. Visitor handles *what you do with many artifact types*; Memento handles *how you rewind one hero's mutable state*.

---

## Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Role in this system |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Visitor** | Walks a mixed inventory of `Weapon`, `Potion`, `Scroll`, `Ring`, and `Armor` through double dispatch. New reports are added by creating new visitors, not by editing artifact classes. |
| **Memento** | Snapshots a hero's mutable state so the Chronomancer's Vault can rewind HP, mana, gold, and inventory after a trap or failed appraisal. |

## Connection to Previous Homeworks

| Homework | Patterns | Theme |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `homework-rpg-7` | Decorator + Facade | Early RPG pattern pairing |
| `homework-rpg-8` | State + Template Method | The Haunted Tower |
| `homework-rpg-9` | Visitor + Memento | Chronomancer's Vault |

The series keeps mixing pattern pairs, but each assignment still asks you to implement the patterns independently and demonstrate them clearly in `Main.java`.
